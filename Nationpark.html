                    <h5>Serengeti</h5>
                    <p>The Park can be divided into 3 sections. The popular <br />southern/central part (Seronera Valley), is what the<br /> Maasai called the “serengit”, the land of endless plains.<br /> It’s classic savannah, dotted with acacias and filled<br
                        /> with wildlife. The western corridor is marked by the <br /> River, and has more forests and dense bush.<br /> The north, Lobo area, meets up with Kenya’s Masai<br /> Mara Reserve, is the least visited section.</p>

                    <p>The main feature of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area include the Ngorongoro Crater, The Serengeti Plains that support about 2.0 millions migratory wildlife species of the Serengeti Mara-ecosystem and the catchment forest; the Northern
                        Highland Forest Reserve known as 'Entim Olturot' in Maasai language. Other important features found in the NCA are the archaeological and palaeontological site located at Oldupai Gorge and the early human foot-prints that were
                        discovered at Alaitole in Ngarusi area.</p>

                    <h5>Manyara</h5>
                    <p>The alkaline soda of Lake Manyara is home to an incredible array of bird life that thrives on its brackish waters. Pink flamingo stoop and graze by the thousands colourful specks against the grey minerals of the lake shore. Yellow-billed
                        storks swoop and corkscrew on thermal winds rising up from the escarpment, and herons flap their wings against the sun-drenched sky. Even reluctant bird-watchers will find something to watch and marvel at within the national park.</p>
